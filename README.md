# QwirklesqueGame


A project that was completed during our Advanced Programming Techniques course. 

The outcome was a command-line game which is based off the board game [Qwirkle!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwirkle)

Overall it was a good learning experience for all involved, with a whole new perspective of the requirements that come
with coding as a group.
